// Task
// Coding in function infiniteLoop. function accept 3 parameters. The 1st parameter is arr, it's a 2D array, it contains three 1D array. The 2nd parameter is d ï¼Œit's a string. The 3rd parameter is n, it's a number.

// You can think of arr as a moat, the elements of arr like water constantly flow in. The direction of flow is controlled by the parameter d. The value of d can be "left" or "right". "left" means the "river" moves to the left. All elements in the 1D array are to the left moving n position, if beyond the bounds of the array and the element is moved to the tail on the left side of the array; if it exceeds the left boundary element would be moved to the tail of 3rd array(like a circle). Right is also similar to the operation, but it is moving to the right.

// Finally, return arr.

function infiniteLoop(arr, d, n) {
  //coding here...
}
