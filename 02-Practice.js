// DESCRIPTION:
// Build Tower
// Build a pyramid-shaped tower, as an array/list of strings, given a positive integer number of floors. A tower block is represented with "*" character.
// For example, a tower with 3 floors looks like this:
// [
//   "  *  ",
//   " *** ",
//   "*****"
// ]
// And a tower with 6 floors looks like this:
// [
//   "     *     ",
//   "    ***    ",
//   "   *****   ",
//   "  *******  ",
//   " ********* ",
//   "***********"
// ]

  // build here
  let tower = [];

  for (let i = 0; i < nFloors; i++) {
    const spaces = " ".repeat(nFloors - (i - 1));
    const stars = "*".repeat(2 * (1 + i));
    tower.push(spaces + stars + spaces);
  }

}

// console.log(towerBuilder(6))

// Description:
// The museum of incredible dull things

// The museum of incredible dull things wants to get rid of some exhibitions. Miriam, the interior architect, comes up with a plan to remove the most boring exhibitions. She gives them a rating, and then removes the one with the lowest rating.

// However, just as she finished rating all exhibitions, she's off to an important fair, so she asks you to write a program that tells her the ratings of the items after one removed the lowest one. Fair enough.
// Task

// Given an array of integers, remove the smallest value. Do not mutate the original array/list. If there are multiple elements with the same value, remove the one with a lower index. If you get an empty array/list, return an empty array/list.

// Don't change the order of the elements that are left.
// Examples

// * Input: [1,2,3,4,5], output = [2,3,4,5]
// * Input: [5,3,2,1,4], output = [5,3,2,4]
// * Input: [2,2,1,2,1], output = [2,2,2,1]
