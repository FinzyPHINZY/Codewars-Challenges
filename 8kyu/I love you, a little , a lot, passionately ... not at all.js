// Who remembers back to their time in the schoolyard, when girls would take a flower and tear its petals, saying each of the following phrases each time a petal was torn:

//     "I love you"
//     "a little"
//     "a lot"
//     "passionately"
//     "madly"
//     "not at all"

// If there are more than 6 petals, you start over with "I love you" for 7 petals, "a little" for 8 petals and so on.

// When the last petal was torn there were cries of excitement, dreams, surging thoughts and emotions.

// Your goal in this kata is to determine which phrase the girls would say at the last petal for a flower of a given number of petals. The number of petals is always greater than 0.
