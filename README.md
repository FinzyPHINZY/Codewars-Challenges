## Introduction

This repository contains my solutions to various CodeWars kata. CodeWars is an online platform that provides coding challenges (kata) of varying difficulty levels. Each challenge is ranked from 8 kyu (easiest) to 1 kyu (hardest).

## File Naming Convention

The files in this repository are named using the following convention:

```
{kata_rank} - {kata_name}.extension
```

- **kata_rank:** The difficulty level of the kata, ranging from 8 to 1 kyu.
- **kata_name:** A brief description of the challenge.
- **extension:** The file extension indicating the programming language used (e.g., .py for Python, .js for JavaScript).

Example: `7 - guess_the_nth_number.js`

## How to Use
